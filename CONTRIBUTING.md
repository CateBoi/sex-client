## Code of the Hacckers

As you can tell, this is all a meme and this project is NOT meant to cause any actual harm in any form.

To make sure that it's kept that way, I'm adding some rules if people would like to contribute:

- You may not add anything before/between the original content (The original image/title).
- No change request should cause any sort of actual harm.
- You may modify the mod DLL and create a pull request, however you'd really have to do something memetastic for it to get approved.
